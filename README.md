I was given a base design which was done with only HTML and CSS. I had to use javascript to build a multi-section landing page that includes dynamic creation of nav items depending on how many sections there are, slide to section on click, slide to the top on click of the go to top button, & thoughtful design regarding the modern standards. I also made some few changes to the base CSS
